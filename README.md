# fitness-app

This is a fitness tracking app set up to track calories, fat, sugar, and other nutritional values. You can create an account and use the app yourself, all you need is to
update all the .php files to use your own db. Originally MySQL was used so there is set up file called log.php which accepts your credentials. This repository is here for
demonstration purposes to help you see how a fullstack php app, equipped with authentication, can work.
